Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
Overview
This project involves conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing real estate listings for properties in Islamabad, Pakistan. The dataset includes various attributes such as property type, price, location, city, province, latitude, longitude, date added, agency, agent, and area size in Marla. The goal is to extract meaningful insights and patterns from the data through visual and statistical analysis.

Project Details
Name: A.V.S. Praneeth Varma
Company: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS
ID: CT08DS6671
Domain: Data Science
Duration: August to September 2024
Mentor: Muzammil
Objective
The primary objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive exploratory data analysis on the given real estate dataset to identify trends, relationships, and potential outliers that could influence property prices and other key factors.

Key Activities
Data Preprocessing:

Loading the dataset and performing initial data cleaning.
Handling missing values to ensure data completeness.
Converting data types to facilitate proper analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzing the data to find patterns and relationships.
Using visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and pair plots to identify trends.
Investigating correlations between variables like property type, location, and price.
Technologies Used
Python: The main programming language used for data analysis.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis, such as handling data frames and time series.
NumPy: For performing numerical operations that are essential for data preprocessing and analysis.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Libraries used for data visualization to create plots and charts that help in understanding the data distributions and relationships.
Scikit-learn: Though primarily for machine learning, itâ€™s used here for data preprocessing steps like encoding and scaling.
Jupyter Notebook: An interactive environment that allows for documentation and execution of code, making it easier to present findings.
